            <div id="left">
                <h1>Josei</h1>
                <p>Josei offers deep storytelling experiences akin to seinen, focusing on complex themes with a mature perspective.</p>

                <h1>Iyashikei</h1>
                <p>While Iyashikei shows can have romance, drama, and comedy to some extent, it is often to a much lower extent than in other forms of slice-of-life
                as too much of a focus in any of those categories would take the focus away from delivering a cathartic experience.</p>

                <h1>Reverse Harem</h1>
                <p>The relationships feel shallow because the guys and their connection to the central character aren't fleshed out enough, 
                so itâ€™s hard to tell them apart. That, or you'll get one guy who is obviously the main love interest, 
                and the rest are there to be attractive props with barely any interiority at all.</p>

                <h1>Horror</h1>
                <p>While horror anime often aims to terrify, some series miss the mark, delivering more emotion, humor, or confusion than fear.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="center">
                <h1>Psychological</h1>
                <p>Focuses on the psychological aspects of the characters and story, either mind games or characters changing and questioning themselves and the world around them.</p>

                <h1>Workplace</h1>
                <p>The theme is attractive because adult anime characters are always featured, which is a break away from the usual anime series with teenagers as its main characters.</p>

                <h1>Shoujo</h1>
                <p>The relatability of the female protagonist's introverted nature and the desire for meaningful relationships with family, 
                friends, and significant others.</p>

                <h1>Vampire</h1>
                <p>This genre was tried and true long before anime became big in the West or the world. So, there is potential to move it from the least popular genre to one of the most popular.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="right">
                <h1>Harem</h1>
                <p>Often criticized for its repetitive plotlines and lack of character development, where one male character is surrounded by multiple female characters vying for his affection.</p>

                <h1>Isekai</h1>
                <p>Isekai is a way to write coming-of-age stories and have them be about grown-ups instead of kids.
                It's a rebirth into a new world (regardiv class="unPopList"ess of how old they are made in the new world), and they come with additional knowledge, making it a handy template for overpowered coming-of-age stories.</p>

                <h1>Ecchi</h1>
                <p>Anime that heavily relies on fanservice can alienate viewers who prefer more substantive storytelling.</p>

                <h1>Slice-of-life</h1>
                <p>While beloved by many for its realism, some viewers may find slice-of-life anime too slow-paced or lacking in action and plot.</p>
